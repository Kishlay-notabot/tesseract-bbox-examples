# tesseract-bbox-examples
Complex examples for tesseract.js which can help users to generate and export bbox data of detected words, crop individual images etc.  
**I strongly recommend to visit the dcda repository to see and understand the use case of this code in detail.**  
These examples are coded and directly implemented during the development of this project https://github.com/Kishlay-notabot/dcda/  
# Why?  
I was working on the dcda project above and I wanted to use Tesseract engine to give me bbox data of the detected symbols/words. I could not find any examples related to it on the internet so I had to reverse engineer the demo code at https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/ and see how the code outlines the bbox data. It introduced me to canvas API. And then it was an easy [not so easy] journey ahead.
